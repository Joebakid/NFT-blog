            <h3 class="py-3">1. Coinbase</h3>
          <p>
            Coinbase announced they're launching an NFT marketplace in 2021. And
            the hype was insane. In less than two days over 2 million people
            signed up for their waitlist. But the end of 2021 came and Coinbase
            NFT still didn't launch yet.Finally they launched a few months
            later. But it was a MASSIVE flop. Nobody used it.
            <p>To put things in perspective...

              GameStop launched their NFT marketplace 5 months after Coinbase.
              
              And they surpassed Coinbase NFTs' lifetime volume in less than 48 hours.</p>

  <h3 class="py-3">2. RTFKT</h3>
          <p>

            RTFKT is one of the most innovative startups in web3.
            
            And on Dec 13th 2021 Nike acquired them.
            
            However there was a problem...</p>
            <p>The acquisition info was leaked early.

              Someone named Sarah put her entire net worth into Clone X two days before and bragged about it on Twitter.</p>
              <img id="img-nft-darkside" class="py-3" src="dark theme icon/retx.png" alt="">

             <p>

              Then tomorrow came, RTFKT got acquired and Clones had a face melting pump.

Sarah then proceeded to dump all her Clones for an insane profit.</p>

<div class="py-5">
  <h3 class="py-3">3. Otherside</h3>
  <p>

    On March 17th, Yuga airdropped their holders $APE. Making their holders even more rich.</p>
    <img src="dark theme icon/ape.png" class="py-3" alt="">

    <p>The very next day Yuga dropped the most viral web3 video of all time.</p>
    <video src="dark theme icon/HkaIkLNg895PCJ4D.mp4" class="py-3" controls  loop muted poster="dark theme icon/nft=preview.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"></video>

    <p>The euphoria was insane.

      $APE tripled in price leading up to the Otherside mint.
      
      And one whale's $APE airdrop became worth $37 million </p>
      <img src="dark theme icon/airdrop-ape.png" class="py-3" alt="">

      <p>But then the Otherside mint happened and it was a disaster.

        Over $150 million worth of ETH was lost to gas fees due to failed transactions.
        
        And even the people who could mint spent up to $7,000 in gas fees to do so.</p>
        <img src="dark theme icon/Fy1ul0iWYAEkMo4.png" class="py-3" alt="">

        <p>Yuga then went on to blame Ethereum for this fuck up instead of themselves </p>
