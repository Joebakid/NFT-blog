            <h3 class="py-3">Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              There are various types of scams prevalent in different areas,
              ranging from connecting wallets to phishing links to highly
              sophisticated PDF scams.
               Here are some of the most common ones
              that I'm familiar with:
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="py-5">
            <h3 class="py-3">1.Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>
              Scammers create fake websites or send fraudulent emails that
              imitate legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, aiming to trick
              users into sharing their login credentials or private keys. To
              stay safe, always verify the website's URL, enable two-factor
              authentication (2FA), and be cautious of unsolicited emails or
              links asking for sensitive information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's an example, the official layerzero page is
             <a href=" https://layerzero.network/"  class="downloadable-link"> 'https://layerzero.network/'</a> which is the first picture and the
              scam page which i'm not going to display the link is the second
              picture. if in an instance you connected ur wallet to the second
              page, you funds would be withdrew in an instance.
            </p>

            <div class="flex-img py-1">
              <img src="dark theme icon/official layerzero.png" alt="" />
             
              
            </div>

            <div class="flex-img">
                <img
                id="img-nft-darkside"
                class="py-3"
                src="dark theme icon/scam layerzero.png"
                alt=""
              />
              
            </div>

            <p>
              An easy way to combat this , is to install some layer of security,
              e.g wallet guide. keeping the official links in a notepad would be
              a wise decision for future references. click here to install
              <a
                class="downloadable-link"

          </div>

          <div class="py-5">
            <h3 class="py-3">2. Twitter Scam</h3>
            <p>
              Link would be advertise on twitter as airdrop claim . this can be
              easily decieful. but another main way this scam occur is that they
              act like the official page of big crypto project. the first image
              is the official zksync account. You could see it has a yellow
              verification badge and much more followers. here's is a link to
              the account
              <a href="https://twitter.com/zksync" target="_blank" class="official-twitter"
                >'@zksync'</a
              >. the second image below is not the offical zksync account. it
              asked users to claim airdrop. this is a scam, your wallet would be
              wipped if u connect.
            </p>

              class="py-3"
              alt=""
            />
            <img src="dark theme icon/scam-zksync.png" class="py-3" alt="" />
          </div>

          <div class="py-5">
            <h3 class="py-3">3. Fake Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)</h3>
            <p>
              Scammers create fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), enticing
              investors to purchase non-existent or worthless tokens. Before
              participating in an ICO, conduct thorough research on the project,
              its team, and its reputation. Look for transparent documentation,
              a viable product or concept, and community engagement. For
              example, in one instance on Crypto Twitter (CT), more than $10
              million was sent to ben.eth for a project called $PSYOP, which
              ultimately failed. Ben.eth is associated with Bitboy, who lacks
              good credibility. This alone should serve as a clear warning not
              to get involved. In another case on CT, people sent money to feyi
              for a project called $STIMMY, although the actual amount is
              unknown. However, the project also ended up failing. While this
              may not appear as a scam, the developer already cashed in on your
              investment. It is wise to be cautious and involve yourself only
              with projects that have credibility. Below is the chart for $PSYOP
              and $STIMMY
            </p>
            <img src="dark theme icon/$PSYOP.png" class="py-3" alt="" />
            <img src="dark theme icon/$STIMMY.png" class="py-3" alt="" />
          </div>

          <div class="py-5">
            <h3 class="py-3">4. PDF SCAM</h3>
            <p>
               A crypto PDF
              document scam is a type of phishing attack that uses a PDF file to
              trick victims into revealing their personal information or
              cryptocurrency credentials. The PDF file may appear to be
              legitimate, such as a news article or a financial report, but it
              will actually contain malicious code that can steal data or
              install malware on the victim's computer. Here are some ways to
              avoid crypto PDF document scams:
              <ul class="list-pdf-scam">
                <li>Do not open PDF files from
                    unknown senders. If you receive a PDF file from someone you do not
                    know, do not open it. Even if the file appears to be from a
                    legitimate source, such as a financial institution or a
                    cryptocurrency exchange, it could be a scam.</li>
                    <li>Scan PDF files for
                        malware before opening them. There are many free online tools that
                        can scan PDF files for malware. If you are unsure whether a PDF
                        file is safe, scan it before opening it. Be careful about clicking
                        links in PDF files.</li>
                        <li>
                            some times, when you open the pdf it already too late. hence, use 
                            another device where your wallet isn't located to do open it. mostly a mobile
                            device where no account is located.
                        </li>
              </ul>
              
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="py-5">
            <h3 class="py-3">4.ANDRIOD APPS</h3>
            <p>
              Most andriod apps sends data back to the developer. this apps
              have access to your clip board. this might be really dangerous.
              for instance, you copy ur seed phrase probably you want to login Intro bitkeep or
              any other wallet. this seedphrase you just copied is saved into ur clip board.
              the unknown app sents this data retrieved to the developer and the developer now has ur seedphrase.
              here are some tips to avoid Android apps that can lead to a hack in your MetaMask:
              <ul class="list-pdf-scam">
                <li>Only download apps from trusted sources. The Google Play Store is a safe place to download apps, but there are other sources that are not as secure. Be careful about downloading apps from third-party app stores or websites.</li>
                    <li>Check the permissions that an app requests before installing it. Some apps may request permissions that they do not need to function properly. If you see an app requesting permissions that seem unnecessary, be wary of installing it..</li>
                        <li>
                            Use a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are the most secure way to store your cryptocurrency. They are physical devices that store your private keys offline, making them much more difficult to hack.
                        </li>
              </ul>
              
            </p>
          </div>
