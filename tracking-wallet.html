                <p>
                  Tracking a crypto wallet is the process of following the
                  transactions that have been made from a specific wallet address.
                  This can be done using a blockchain explorer, which is a website
                  that allows you to view the public ledger of a blockchain. There
                  are a number of reasons why someone might want to track a crypto
                  wallet. For example, an investor might want to track the
                  transactions of a large wallet to see if it is being used by a
                  whale, or a law enforcement agency might want to track a wallet
                  that is suspected of being involved in criminal activity. they are
                  various degen tools to be familiar with. some which are :

                    <div class="py-5">
                      <h4>Zerion</h4>
                      <p>
                        Eben used the omnichain (layerzero) to do some bridge some
                        usdc from optimism mainet to an L2 mainnet. But he forgot
                        which L2 he bridged to, he couldn't figure it out. he went
                        throught his metamask but he doesnot have usdc contract address
                        of any L2 and hasn't added usdc to any L2 chain in his
                        wallet. I introduce him to Zerion, he took his metamask seed
                        phrase and imported into Zerion. there the optimism usdc was ,
                        staring at him. zerion supports eth L2(optimism,arbitrum),
                        avalanche,binance smart chain,fantom. zerion also has an alert 
                        feature to tell whenever a particular address buy/sell a token.
                        zerion is also a secure and well known wallet.

                        0xaee2ae13ebf81d38df5a9ed7013e80ea3f72e39b made $56m in the last hours. tried to use
                        explorer to look at his holding but couldn't understand the
                        interface properly(looked old model). Heard some folks
                        talking about on chain analytic earlier on a space on
                        twitter and one of them mention debank. i opened up google
                        and went on debank. i could see clearly how this whale moved
                        funds around on all chains. what shitcoin he degened in and
                        what platform he traded and what token currently holds. i
                        could also see what liquidity pool he's into. this was a
                        great incite and an alpha.

                        Arkham is now fully accessible, it is a portfolio tracking similar to Zerion.

    The difference is that it can be used to track institutional entities like VCs, CEXs, investing funds, and others.
    you could also track your wallet/whales on the platform.
    It's a great tool to analyze on-chain data and track other wallets.

                I will end this section by warning you about tracking whales wallet.

                <ol>
                              <li>They get rugged a lot

                                If you have never been rugged, scammed or lost money in crypto, you probably havenâ€™t tried hard enough .
                                
                                When it comes to whales, they get rugged a lot thats why they have a 7-9 figures portfolio- Big risk takers</li>
                                <li>
                                  When a rug happens, be sure that some whales just lost over 7 figures.

                                  When tracking whales wallets, you have to question their judgement
                                  
                                  When you see them investing into a project that looks shady, you should trust your gut & not invest because they can afford to get rugged
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Rapid Change in their strategies

                Whales have a very active portfolio, hence the rapid changes.

                If you go through their transactions most especially the smart ones, you will see they do transactions every hour- thereâ€™s always something to do.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  ts either harvesting yield, shuffling LP positions, aping into new projects, bridging between chains, sending to exchanges or swapping to stables.

                This is necessary because the market itself changes rapidly especially during times like this.

                Looks overwhelming yeah?

                                  Fake Transactions 

                There are a lot of accounts that post about tracking whale wallets in this space.

                However, most people donâ€™t know how to spot a real transaction from a fake one.

                <h2>DEGEN</h2>
                <p>
                  In the context of the crypto community, "degen" is short for
                  "degenerate" and is often used to refer to a person who is
                  involved in high-risk, speculative trading or investing in
                  cryptocurrencies. Degens are typically seen as risk-takers who are
                  willing to put their money into projects that are considered to be
                  high-risk or even scams. They are often attracted to new and
                  innovative projects (shitcoins), even if they have not been
                  properly vetted. The term "degen" can be traced back to the
                  gambling world, where it was used to describe people who gambled
                  too much or regularly made bad bets. In the crypto community, the
                  term has taken on a more specific meaning, referring to people who
                  are willing to take on a high degree of risk in the hopes of
                  making a quick profit.
